## Active Stack Profile: generic

## Enforced Policy Matrix (40 Policies Loaded)
- **[STRICT-BLOCK] Modular Architecture Policy** (`05-architecture`): Enforces clean separation of concerns, public contract boundaries, and small composable units.
- **[WARNING] God File Limit** (`06-god-files`): Flags oversized files that accumulate too many responsibilities — "god files" that violate single-responsibility and become unmaintainable.
- **[WARNING] Domain-Driven Layout** (`07-domain-layout`): Enforces domain-driven project structure — source files must be grouped by domain/bounded context, not dumped flat into a single directory.
- **[STRICT-BLOCK] Coding Standards Policy** (`07-coding-standards`): Requires strict linting, formatting, type checking, and test verification before completion.
- **[WARNING] Debug Statement Hygiene** (`08-debug-leftovers`): Flags debugging statements left in source — console.log, debugger, pdb breakpoints, and print-debugging should not ship.
- **[INFO] Deferred Work Hygiene** (`09-todo-hygiene`): Tracks TODO/FIXME/HACK accumulation — a file drowning in deferred-work markers signals unfinished or unstable code.
- **[WARNING] Dependency Freshness** (`10-dependency-freshness`): Flags outdated dependencies by shelling out to the ecosystem package manager (npm outdated, go list -m -u) when the toolchain is installed and the registry is reachable.

- **[STRICT-BLOCK] Insecure API Sinks** (`05-insecure-api-sinks`): Blocks dangerous API calls that create injection, XSS, or transport-security holes — eval, raw DOM HTML injection, TLS verification bypass, shell string execution, weak crypto on credentials.
- **[STRICT-BLOCK] Sensitive File Guard** (`06-sensitive-files`): Blocks scanning/working on committed sensitive files — env files, private keys, certificates, and credential stores must never live in the source tree.
- **[STRICT-BLOCK] Deprecated Package Guard** (`07-deprecated-packages`): Flags dependencies that are deprecated, renamed, abandoned, or carry known vulnerabilities — checked against the built-in advisory database in every manifest the scanner finds.
- **[STRICT-BLOCK] Technology Stack Policy** (`01-stack`): Enforces project-declared tech stack boundaries and prevents casual introduction of unapproved frameworks.
- **[STRICT-BLOCK] Version Constraint Policy** (`02-versions`): Enforces version policy rules (current-stable, project-compatible, pinned) over raw 'latest'.

### Policy: Modular Architecture Policy
Architecture Rules:
- Respect module and package boundaries; use public APIs, shared packages, or contracts.
- Never import other features' private internals.
- Prefer small, composable units with single responsibility.

### Policy: God File Limit
God File Rules:
- A single file must not exceed 500 lines; split by responsibility before it grows.
- A file must not declare more than 40 top-level symbols (functions, classes, types).
- Mixed-responsibility files (UI + data access + orchestration) must be decomposed
  into cohesive units colocated with their domain.
- Prefer many small modules over one large one; extraction beats accumulation.
- No function may exceed 80 lines; long bodies hide multiple responsibilities.
- Keep per-function branching (ifs, loops, cases, boolean ops, catches) under 12 —
  beyond that, decompose into named helpers.

### Policy: Domain-Driven Layout
Domain Layout Rules:
- Group source files by bounded context/domain (e.g. auth/, billing/, inventory/),
  never as a flat pile in one directory.
- No directory may hold more than 15 source files; split domains further.
- Once a project exceeds 12 source files, at least 60% must live inside
  domain-named subdirectories.
- Entry points and composition roots stay at the edge; domain logic nests.

### Policy: Coding Standards Policy
Quality Assurance Rules:
- Run type checking (`tsc` or stack equivalent) before declaring completion.
- Run linter/formatter (`eslint`, `prettier`, `pint`, `php-cs-fixer`).
- Ensure automated unit/integration tests pass cleanly.

### Policy: Debug Statement Hygiene
Debug Hygiene Rules:
- Remove console.log, debugger, pdb.set_trace, binding.pry, fmt.Println, println!,
  and System.out.println debugging before committing.
- Use structured logging with levels when runtime diagnostics are intentional.

### Policy: Deferred Work Hygiene
Deferred Work Rules:
- More than 5 TODO/FIXME/HACK/XXX markers in one file means the work is not done —
  resolve or ticket them, don't accumulate them.
- Every marker should reference a tracking issue (e.g. TODO(#123)).

### Policy: Dependency Freshness
Dependency Freshness Rules:
- Keep dependencies current; outdated majors accumulate security debt.
- The check only runs when the package manager binary exists and the
  registry is reachable — an info note is emitted when it is skipped.
- Batch upgrades by domain; pin intentionally-frozen deps with a comment.

### Policy: architecture
# Policy: Architectural Governance

## Policy Statement

Agents must enforce modular boundaries, single responsibility, and prevent God files or component explosion.

## Rules

1. **No God Files**:
   - Avoid creating 1000+ line files containing mixed business and presentation logic.
2. **No Component Explosion**:
   - Do not split small 3-line snippets into unnecessary micro-components.
3. **Layering Integrity**:
   - Keep business and domain logic out of UI view components when the project architecture provides a domain layer.

### Policy: change-management
# Policy: Change Management & Destructive Operations

## Policy Statement

Agents must distinguish non-destructive inspection from disruptive refactoring and request user approval for destructive changes.

## Rules

1. **Ask Before Destructive Cleanup**:
   - Present recommendations to the user before deleting files, replacing core libraries, altering database schemas, or changing design systems.
2. **Minimal Scoped Modifications**:
   - Scope code edits tightly to the task requirements without making collateral edits to unrelated files.

### Policy: current-conventions
# Policy: Current Conventions & Standards

## Policy Statement

All code generated by AgentJam agents must adhere to the project's active conventions and framework standards.

## Rules

1. **Framework Precedence**:
   - Framework-specific conventions take precedence over generic language defaults (e.g. Laravel conventions over generic PHP PSR standards).
2. **Version Policies**:
   - `current-stable`: Highest production-ready major release.
   - `project-compatible`: Version compatible with existing lockfiles.
   - `pinned`: Locked strictly to project manifest versions.

### Policy: dependencies
# Policy: Dependency Governance

## Policy Statement

Agents must respect project dependency boundaries and prevent unapproved package inflation.

## Rules

1. **No Forbidden Dependencies**:
   - Check `stacks/<profile>/` and project manifests before introducing packages.
2. **No Duplicate Libraries**:
   - Do not install competing libraries (e.g. Axios when Fetch/Native HTTP is configured, second icon library).
3. **Audit First**:
   - Verify package compatibility and maintenance status before recommending updates.

### Policy: documentation
# Policy: Code Documentation & Comments

## Policy Statement

Documentation must focus on non-obvious rationale, architectural design decisions, and complex domain invariants.

## Rules

1. **Preserve Existing Comments**:
   - Maintain existing docstrings and comments unrelated to modified lines.
2. **No Superficial Comments**:
   - Do not add comments restating trivial syntax (e.g. `// increment i by 1`).

### Policy: inspect-before-act
# Policy: Inspect Before Acting

## Policy Statement

Agents must inspect project manifests, tooling, and existing architecture before making modifications.

## Rules

1. **Mandatory Inspection Steps**:
   - Inspect package manifests (`package.json`, `composer.json`, etc.).
   - Identify existing linter, formatter, type checker, and test framework configurations.
   - Locate design token definitions and component conventions before authoring UI code.
2. **No Blind Guesses**:
   - Never infer variable names, API routes, or file paths without inspecting the source codebase first.

### Policy: model-knowledge
# Policy: Model Knowledge Precedence

## Policy Statement

Model training data is a reasoning material, NOT a source of truth for framework APIs, package versions, recommended tooling, or current security practices.

## Rules

1. **Precedence Enforcement**:
   - `Current project state` > `Project config` > `Pinned AgentJam rules` > `Authoritative documentation` > `Model knowledge`.
2. **Fallback Verification**:
   - If an API or library convention cannot be verified through current documentation or project manifests, the agent must report that verification is unavailable.
3. **No Deprecated API Introduction**:
   - Do not introduce APIs or syntax marked deprecated in current official documentation.

### Policy: security
# Policy: Security & Secret Management

## Policy Statement

Zero tolerance for committed secrets, unparameterized database queries, and unvalidated input boundaries.

## Rules

1. **Secrets Governance**:
   - Never commit or hardcode API keys, passwords, or credentials. Use environment variables.
2. **Parameterized Queries**:
   - Parameterize all SQL and ORM queries to prevent injection attacks.
3. **Boundary Input Validation**:
   - Validate and sanitize external input at HTTP endpoints, webhooks, and message queues.

### Policy: testing
# Policy: Testing Standards

## Policy Statement

All code changes must be accompanied by relevant test coverage adhering to project test frameworks.

## Rules

1. **No Dummy Assertions**:
   - Tests must verify real function contracts without swallow-all try/catches or dummy fallbacks.
2. **Colocation & Convention**:
   - Follow existing project test directory or colocation naming conventions.

### Policy: Dependency Boundary Policy
Dependency Rules:
- Do not install unapproved third-party packages without verifying stack profile compatibility.
- Avoid duplicate helper packages when standard library or existing dependencies provide equivalent functionality.

### Policy: accessibility
# Accessibility (a11y) Policy

## Accessibility Standards

1. **Contrast Ratios**: All text and interactive elements must satisfy WCAG AA contrast standards minimum.
2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure visible focus outlines (`focus-visible`) and logical tabIndex flows.
3. **Semantic HTML5**: Use `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<button>` appropriately.
4. **Form Labels**: Every form input must have a corresponding `<label>` or explicit `aria-label`.

### Policy: animation
# Animation & Motion Policy

## Forbidden Excessive Animation Slop

Agents MUST NOT automatically add:
- Animated gradient backgrounds
- Floating card bounce effects
- Parallax background scrolling everywhere
- Text reveal animations on every header
- Hover scale animations on every element
- Continuous background noise animations

## Purposeful Motion Rules

1. **State Feedback Only**: Animation must serve a functional purpose (modal opening, dropdown transition, form error feedback).
2. **Reduced Motion Support**: Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries.
3. **Subtle Durations**: Keep transition durations subtle (150ms - 250ms).

### Policy: anti-slop
# Anti-AI-Slop Policy

This policy strictly prohibits generic AI-generated visual patterns and lazy interface defaults across all agents.

## Prohibited Visual Slop

Agents MUST NOT automatically produce:

- Generic SaaS dashboards with meaningless metric cards
- Generic hero sections with floating 3D elements
- Interchangeable card grids without domain differentiation
- Meaningless decorative gradients or glowing borders
- Excessive rounded cards (`rounded-3xl`, `rounded-2xl` everywhere)
- Excessive glassmorphism and backdrop blurs (`backdrop-blur-xl`)
- Unnecessary floating or hovering elements
- Decorative blobs, abstract background shapes, or mesh gradients
- Generic "trusted by" logo strips or artificial testimonial grids
- Visual decoration that does not communicate information or hierarchy

## Intentionality Rule

1. The agent MUST be able to explain the purpose of every major visual element.
2. Visual decisions MUST NOT be made merely because they are common in AI-generated examples.
3. Optimize for: **product identity, usability, structural hierarchy, clarity, consistency, accessibility, and context**.

### Policy: color
# Color Policy

## Forbidden Color Defaults

Agents MUST NOT default to:
- Neon colors
- Indigo (`#4F46E5` / Tailwind indigo)
- Generic electric blue (`#3B82F6`)
- Generic purple
- Blue/purple gradients
- Neon gradients or arbitrary rainbow background fills

## Palette Derivation Rules

1. **Derive from Established Direction**: Colors must be derived from the project's design system tokens (`tokens.css`, `tailwind.config`, CSS variables).
2. **No Invented Palettes**: Do not invent a new color palette simply because one is missing. Ask for direction or inspect existing brand assets first.
3. **Functional Color Application**: Use color purposefully for state (success, warning, error, info) and primary action contrast, not for background noise.

### Policy: components
# Component & Design Token Policy

## No Inline Design Tokens

Design tokens MUST NOT be hardcoded inside components.

**Forbidden**:
```tsx
<div style={{ color: "#344C36" }} />
```
or
```tsx
className="text-[#344C36]"
```

All reusable colors, spacing, border radii, typography values, shadows, and animation durations must reference central design tokens (`theme/`, `styles/`, `tokens.css`).

## Balanced Component Architecture

- **No God Components**: Do not place entire pages or 2000+ lines of logic inside a single component file (`Everything.tsx`).
- **No Component Explosion**: Do not split simple markup into hundreds of single-line micro-wrapper files.
- **Component Decomposition Criteria**: Create reusable components based on single responsibility, domain domain meaning, clear prop interfaces, and maintainability.

### Policy: copy
# Product Copy & Anti-Marketing Slop Policy

## Prohibited AI Marketing Buzzwords

Product copy MUST NOT sound like generic AI marketing slop.

**Forbidden Wording Patterns**:

- "Empower your business..."
- "Unlock the power of..."
- "Transform your workflow with our powerful platform..."
- "Seamlessly connect everything in one place..."
- "The future of..."
- "Next-generation..."
- "Cutting-edge..."
- "Game-changing..."
- "Supercharge your..."
- "Elevate your..."
- "Harness the power of..."
- "Optimize your..."
- "Streamline your..."
- "Unlock the potential of..."
- "Experience the difference..."
- "Revolutionize your..."
- "Operating System"

## Stylized AI Punctuation Policy

Avoid copy that relies on recognizable AI text patterns:

- Excessive em dashes (`—`)
- Dramatic sentence fragments ("Not X. But Y.")
- Artificial pauses or hyperbolic framing ("Whether you're a startup or an enterprise...")

## Human Product Copy Rules

Write clear, direct human copy that communicates:

1. What the product actually does.
2. Who it is for.
3. What concrete problem it solves.
4. Specific capabilities and features in natural language.

### Policy: design-system
# Mandatory Design Direction Request Policy

## Design Discovery Requirement

When an agent is asked to create or substantially redesign a UI and no established design system exists:

1. The agent MUST NOT proceed by inventing generic SaaS fallback styles.
2. The agent MUST request or determine:
   - **Design Direction**: Visual style, brand personality, color direction, typography, density.
   - **Design Tools / Assets**: Figma files, design token files, icon libraries, component libraries, brand guidelines.

## Established Project Priority

If the project ALREADY possesses an established design system (brand colors, tokens, component library, font choices):
- The agent MUST inspect and follow the existing design system as the primary source of truth.
- Do NOT replace an existing coherent design system with generic defaults.

### Policy: icons
# Iconography Policy

## Emoji UI Icons Strictly Forbidden

Emoji MUST NOT be used as interface icons or visual action buttons.

**Forbidden**:
```text
🚀  💡  ⚡  🔥  ❤️  📊
```

## Icon Library Governance

1. **Use Single Project Icon System**: Inspect the project's existing icon library (e.g. Lucide, Heroicons, FontAwesome, SVG icons) before introducing icons.
2. **No Duplicate Icon Libraries**: Do not install or import a second icon library if the codebase already uses one.
3. **Accessibility**: All icon-only buttons must include `aria-label` attribute descriptions.

### Policy: responsive
# Responsive Design Policy

## Responsive Rules

1. **Mobile-First Layouts**: Design and code layout structures starting from mobile viewport bounds upward.
2. **Standard Breakpoint Scales**: Align layout queries with project design token breakpoints.
3. **No Horizontal Scroll Overflows**: Ensure containers and tables adjust cleanly on narrow touch displays.

### Policy: spacing
# Spacing & Layout Density Policy

## Spacing Rules

1. **Use Token Spacing Scale**: All padding, margin, gap, and grid layout dimensions must use the project's design token spacing scale (`var(--space-4)`, `p-4`, `gap-6`).
2. **Forbidden Arbitrary Spacing**: Never hardcode inline arbitrary offsets (`margin-top: 13px`, `padding: 11px`) inside components.
3. **Responsive Spacing Hierarchy**: Maintain proportional spacing density across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

### Policy: typography
# Typography Policy

## Typography Rules

1. **Do Not Default to AI Typography Slop**: Do NOT automatically select Inter, Roboto, Poppins, Montserrat, Space Grotesk, or browser fallback defaults simply because no font is specified.
2. **Inspect Existing System**:
   - Inspect existing project typography declarations, CSS `@import` / Google Font loads, and CSS custom properties.
   - Preserve existing heading/body hierarchy.
3. **Request Direction for New Projects**:
   - For new projects with no typography system, request typography direction before picking fonts.
4. **Explicit "Noto" Exception**:
   - If the user explicitly specifies **"use Noto"**, use the appropriate Noto font family (e.g., Noto Sans / Noto Serif) and do not request typography clarification again.

### Policy: visual-language
# Visual Language & Direction

## Core Principles

1. **Product Identity First**: Derive visual aesthetics from the specific product domain, target audience, and brand personality.
2. **Hierarchy & Clarity**: Use size, weight, contrast, and layout position to indicate functional importance rather than relying on decorative background cards.
3. **Consistency**: Align layout geometry, elevation levels, and typography scaling across all pages.

### Policy: Documentation Freshness Policy
CRITICAL RULE: TRAINING KNOWLEDGE ≠ SOURCE OF TRUTH

Before making framework-specific or library implementation decisions:
1. Determine the project's exact required framework version.
2. Check current supported API conventions.
3. Consult configured authoritative documentation sources.
4. Prefer current documentation over LLM memory.
5. Do not introduce deprecated APIs or removed features.
6. Do not assume historical conventions remain valid.
7. If current information cannot be verified, stop and report that verification is unavailable.

### Policy: existing-project
# Policy: Existing Project Integration

## Policy Statement

Installing AgentJam into an existing codebase requires performing an initial project audit before writing feature code.

## Rules

1. **Mandatory Audit Sequence**:
   - Inspect → Audit → Recommend House Cleaning → Establish Context → Resolve Conventions → Implement → Validate.
2. **Preserve Established Systems**:
   - Follow existing project conventions, design tokens, and architectural boundaries.

### Policy: freshness
# Policy: Technology Freshness & Documentation Rules

## Policy Statement

TRAINING KNOWLEDGE ≠ SOURCE OF TRUTH. All framework and library decisions must be verified against current official documentation.

## Rules

1. **Max Age Constraint**: Default maximum documentation age is 7 days.
2. **Unverified Information Handling**: Stop and report if authoritative documentation cannot be verified.

### Policy: house-cleaning
# Policy: House Cleaning Recommendations

## Policy Statement

Project audits must produce structured, categorized House Cleaning Reports before starting new features.

## Categorization Standards

- **Critical**: Security risks, secret leaks, broken builds, or unsafe dependencies.
- **Recommended**: Duplicate icon libraries, hardcoded colors bypassing design tokens, duplicate helper utilities.
- **Optional**: Directory organization cleanup, unused import removal.

### Policy: stack
# Policy: Project Stack Definition

## Policy Statement

Project stack definitions (`.agentjam/stack.yaml` or `stacks/<profile>`) strictly constrain allowed languages, frameworks, package managers, databases, and ORMs.

## Rules

- Agents must not introduce frameworks or libraries outside the active stack profile without explicit authorization.

### Policy: Security & Secret Management Policy
Security Requirements:
- Never hardcode or commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. Use environment variables.
- Parameterize all SQL/ORM database queries.
- Validate and sanitize external input at HTTP and queue boundaries.

### Policy: Insecure API Sinks
Insecure Sink Rules:
- Never call eval(), new Function(), or set innerHTML / dangerouslySetInnerHTML with dynamic data.
- Never disable TLS verification (InsecureSkipVerify, verify=False, rejectUnauthorized: false).
- Never execute shell strings built by concatenation (os.system, child_process.exec, Runtime.exec).
- Never hash passwords or secrets with MD5/SHA1 — use bcrypt, argon2, or scrypt.
- Prefer https:// URLs; http:// is only acceptable for localhost development.

### Policy: Sensitive File Guard
Sensitive File Rules:
- .env files, private keys, certificates, and credential JSON never belong in the repo.
- Use environment variables or a secret manager; commit only *.example templates.
- If a sensitive file already exists, rotate its secrets — deleting the file is not enough.

### Policy: Deprecated Package Guard
Deprecated Package Rules:
- Packages that are archived, renamed, or carry known CVEs must be replaced —
  the scan report names the recommended replacement for every finding.
- strict-block findings (e.g. dgrijalva/jwt-go, pycrypto, satori/go.uuid) are
  active vulnerabilities — fix before shipping.
- warning findings are maintenance-mode packages — migrate on the next
  refactor touch, do not add them to new code.

### Policy: Technology Stack Policy
Before introducing a new framework, ORM, or database engine:
1. Check the project's stack definition (.agentjam/stack.yaml or stacks/<profile>).
2. Do not introduce alternative frameworks (e.g. Express into NestJS, MongoDB into PostgreSQL) without explicit approval.

### Policy: Version Constraint Policy
Version Selection Rules:
- 'current-stable': Use the latest stable major release suitable for production.
- 'project-compatible': Select the highest version compatible with existing project constraints.
- 'pinned': Lock version strictly to project lockfile.
